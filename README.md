# Robot_named_Rob
Study on python/arduino/tensor-flow
Project came from an idea of probing AI in a visual manner
Used a initial robot set wich was integrated 3 mores sensors and a bluetooth interface
So, robot had 4 distance sensors to detect frontal, lateral and rear distances and a bluetooth interface to send and receive data or moviment commands
There is a initial python and arduino set of codes that were used to pilot the robot using computer
It was logged at this phase the command (move forward, backward, turn right or left) and change on environment based on change on sensors measures previous and after command
Second phase
There was some manual treatment on separating infos on file generated by first phase - separated command from sensor info
Used python language to treat those files
after that files used for training tensor-flow method
In sequence robot programing was change to send sensor info and wait for command from python code
Python code get sensor info and insert it in the tensor model so it could predict best command to move robot
Robot received and obbeyed the command

As it was just a learning project any sugestion or contribution would be appreciated
