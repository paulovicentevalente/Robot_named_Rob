The study focused on a Python/Arduino/TensorFlow project, driven by the curiosity of exploring AI in an actual situation. Initially, a basic robot kit was used, into which three additional sensors and a Bluetooth interface were integrated. Consequently, the four distance sensors equipped on the robot detected front, side, and rear measurements. Furthermore, the Bluetooth interface enabled the transmission or reception of data and movement commands.
The project included an initial phase where training data would be generated and a second phase where this data would support the creation of a model through TensorFlow that would autonomously drive the robot.
In the project's initial phase, a set of Python and Arduino codes were used to create a remote-control interface for the robot operated via a computer. Commands such as “forward”, “move backward”, “turn right”, or “turn left” were recorded at this stage, allowing the creation of a training file that expressed the piloting exercised by the programmer.
Moving on to the second phase, code was created in Python that, using the TensorFlow library, created an autonomous piloting model that responded to information received via Bluetooth from the sensors that operated on the robot.
At the end of the project, the robot responded to commands received from the computer's Python code, generated autonomously. The project has been completed.

As it was just a learning project any suggestion or contribution would be appreciated.
